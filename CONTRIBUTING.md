`DMGL` is currently a work-in-progress. Some features may be incomplete or may contain bugs. Any bug fixes in existing code would be greatly appreciated.

### Adding additional mapper support

`DMGL` only implements a few of the common mappers the original Gameboy supported. Adding more mappers will increase the number of games supported.
